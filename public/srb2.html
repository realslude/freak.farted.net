                <p>ShitBob was my first public SRB2 addon</p>
                <p>. . .</p>
                <p>Not much to say here...</p>
            </span>
        </div>
        <p>I used to be really proud of it, at the time it was the only SpongeBob addon on the Message Board</p>
        <p>Most people seemed to like it :P</p>
        <p>Now I hate it, should've never made something so low effort and tried to pass it off as the best thing you'll ever see. It was a joke taken too far</p>
        <p><small>That's basically what 99% of the Message Board is anyways.</small></p>
        <p>Half a year later an <a href="https://mb.srb2.org/addons/spongebob-squarepants-supersponge.7036/" target="_blank"> actual good SpongeBob SquarePants addon</a> released. By looking at the downloads both our addons got, SpongeBob/Sonic fans aren't something to be messed with.</p>
        <p>One of the SRB2 content farms made a video on it so that's pretty cool</p>

                <p>Oh boy... from creating something as bad as ShitBob then going to <b>this</b>... is crazy</p>
                <p>I was and <i>still</i> am really proud of what SRB5b came out to be</p>
            </span>
        </div>
        <p>Originally only having Book with left over content from ShitBob to having Book, Ice Cube, Match and Bubble debatable and a more accurate grab is pretty fucking cool.</p>
        <p>It was a lot of fun to make, specially Episodes 1 & 2. In Episode 2 when Pacola was recoding the grab I made sure that a "bug" was kept, the bug was that two players could fly by spam throwing each other- this was seen in the original BFDIA 5b game ( ^ . ^ )</p>
        <p>No SRB2 content farms uploaded anything about SRB5b but smaller accounts posted about it and everytime I see SRB5b in the wild I get really excited!!!</p>

                <p>A game mode addon that I'm making because I thought game mode mods on the Message Board are boring</p> 
                <p>The plan is to add <B>a lot.</B></p>
            </span>
        </div>
        <p>Despite being made in and for a Sonic game, I want it to be the biggest love letter to the Mario series ever imagined.</p>
        <p>When the addon releases to the Message Board, I would continue to work on it to add an entire RPG section to the mod that is meant to be played in single player with dialogue and missions to complete!</p>
